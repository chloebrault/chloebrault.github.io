In the decades since, critics called Vallières’ first book a “classic” and an “integral part of Quebec history.” By 2019 however, those who continued to utter the title in Canadian universities and on public radio and television started to face denunciation. Complaints led to putative cancellations, followed by investigations, new legislation regarding hateful anti-Black language on publicly funded media, and finally, arguments against censorship in the name of free speech and the preservation of Quebecois culture. This project built a corpus of references to White [N-words] of America in French-language newspapers that spanned 1968 to 2023. How did the language around Vallières’ book change? How did it stay the same? We used computational tools including topic modeling and PCA to identify and characterize the key positions in conversation around this book, both historically and currently.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/cesta_anthology_pca-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/cesta_anthology_pca-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/cesta_anthology_pca-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/cesta_anthology_pca.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="pca" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Zoomed-out view of our results from Principal Component Analysis, which helped us to visualize the associations across texts. </div> <p>This research was conducted as a part of my DH fellowship at CESTA.
