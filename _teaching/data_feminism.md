I co-hosted this two-part reading group in Spring 2024 at Stanford’s Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis as a follow up to [Data for Humanists](https://chloebrault.github.io/teaching/data_for_humanists/). We read selections from Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein’s [*Data Feminism*](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/) (MIT U Press, 2020). Our discussion was the opportunity to prepare for Lauren Klein’s visit for her talks [Data Feminism for AI](https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/data-feminism-ai-0) and [Data of Enslavement](https://cesta.stanford.edu/events/mellon-sawyer-seminar-series-data-enslavement-lauren-klein-alex-borucki-and-gregory-omalley) as part of the Mellon Sawyer Seminar Series [*The Data that Divides Us*](https://cesta.stanford.edu/research/2023-2024-mellon-sawyer-seminar-series-data-divides-us?search=data+that+divides+us).
