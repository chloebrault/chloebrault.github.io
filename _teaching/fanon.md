I will teach "Fanon" at Stanford University for the Departments of French, Comparative Literature, and Feminist, Gender & Sexuality Studies, and the Center for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity in Spring 2025. The course showcases how my assignments center free open-source programs, like Zotero and Tropy. My assignments ask my learners to students to write for more than one target audience: for peer scholars, using Zotero and Tropy annotation functions, and for the general public, by proposing edits to Wikipedia.

_Course description_

Frantz Fanon was extraordinarily prolific during his short life. He was the twentieth century’s foremost theorist of blackness and anti-colonial liberation, but also a practicing research psychiatrist and a revolutionary. Today, Fanon is an essential reference for research and teaching in topics of race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality. This course explores Fanon’s multiple and long-lasting legacies all while taking him on his own terms.

His books and essays shaped the work of the most important scholars of race and ethnicity of the past half-century. Paul Gilroy described Black Skin, White Masks as “epoch-making,” becoming “more important as the years have gone by.” Stuart Hall described Fanon’s Wretched of the Earth the “Bible of decolonization,” and Angela Davis cites the book for insights on prison abolition to this day. Fanon’s writing also shaped the work of numerous scholars of gender and sexuality. bell hooks called Fanon one of her intellectual parents that both nurtured and gave her perspective on her personal and intellectual lust for freedom.

Fanon was beyond any doubt a great man, but we will have to take an anti-great man approach to taking him on own terms. In other words, Fanon’s own famous “final prayer” will guide our study: “O my body, always make me a man who questions!” Going back to the basics with Fanon—asking hard questions of Fanon’s writing and the scholars who’ve taken up his writing since—will take us on a journey from Martinique to mainland France and colonial Algeria. Along the way, we will take up Fanon’s fiercest feminist critics, who will guide us in making sense of his descriptions of women as cynical lovers and revolutionary fighters, and homosexual men as prey of a white man’s disease.

Course discussions will focus on texts by Fanon, with special emphasis on Black Skin, White Masks and The Wretched of the Earth, and will also reflect learnings from texts and films about Fanon in addition to films about the Algerian War. We will maintain a race and ethnicity lens throughout the course, and a gender and sexuality lens even when Fanon does not explicitly write about gendered or psychosexual others.

_Learning objectives_

At the end of that course, students will be able to use communication as a form of inquiry, invention, and reflection and communicate effectively for the specified audience in more than one genre, medium, or mode. This means students will be additionally be able to

- Discern the content of Fanon’s texts
- Observe the formal features of Fanon’s texts
- Analyze their own discernment and observations
- Organize clear and precise arguments using texts as evidence
- Implement various pre-writing and pre-speaking strategies
- Use efficient and precise vocabulary in writing to discuss the multiple critical legacies of Fanon in gender, sexuality, race, and ethnicity studies
- Use efficient and precise vocabulary to discuss Fanon’s writing and critical legacies, resulting in writing that would be accessible to a lay audience, i.e. someone interested on learning about Fanon on Wikipedia

_Assignments, selection_

_Annotations assignment_

Fanon’s writing shaped the work of many scholars working at the intersection of race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality studies today. In this assignment, students will prepare annotations of 450-600 words for two critical sources that cite Fanon. The purpose of the assignment is to collaboratively prepare an annotated bibliography that will reflect the breadth of Fanon critical legacies. The class' bibliography will be hosted on Zotero. Students will be evaluated on their use of efficient and precise vocabulary. The instructor’s feedback will provide instruction for how to prepare the final assignment.

_Final assignment_

Wikipedia is an important resource for non-experts. But Wikipedia only stays relevant as resources only with continuous crowd-sourced improvements reflecting the combined topic expertise of multiple users. For the final assignment, students will build on feedback provided on previous assignments (staged reading, close reading, annotations) and propose edits to the English-language Wikipedia page for Frantz Fanon or other closely associated topics.
