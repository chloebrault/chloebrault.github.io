I designed this workshop as part of my writing tutor role at Stanford's Hume Center for Writing and Speaking. I was invited to deliver this workshop three times to advanced undergraduate classrooms preparing honors theses and capstone projects. After I demo Zotero for citation management and bibliography, the learners experiment with the “slip-box method” for note-taking, which gives priority to thoughtful organization of ideas and notes, using “child notes” and tagging functions within Zotero.
