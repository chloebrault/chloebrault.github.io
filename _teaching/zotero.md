As a part of my position at Hume Center, I realized that students and scholars alike struggle with keeping track of citations. It is challenging. I designed this workshop to be accessible to broader audiences. A citation manager is an incredibly useful tool that makes everyone's writing process easier, allowing them to discover the joys and pleasures of writing.

This course became a stable in my portfolio. I was invited to teach it in advanced undergraduate classrooms in different departments.

I believe in learning and adapting cutting edge education technologies. I am currently working on expanding my own skills and developing a course on Tropy, a primary source management software.
