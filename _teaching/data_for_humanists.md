I co-hosted this six-part workshop with the goal of setting a low barrier to entry for graduate and advanced undergraduate students wanting to explore the affordances of using data to build and sustain humanistic arguments. We assigned the work of digital humanities scholars local to Stanford (Quinn Dombrowski, among others) and then invited them to join us to discuss their work, the data they use, how they manage that data, the challenges the data presents, and the methods they use to overcome those challenges.
