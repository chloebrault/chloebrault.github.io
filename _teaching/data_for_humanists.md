I co-hosted this four-part series in Winter 2024. The goal of setting a low barrier to entry for graduate and advanced undergraduate students wanting to explore the affordances of using data to build and sustain humanistic arguments. We assigned the work of digital humanities scholars local to Stanford (Quinn Dombrowski, Anne Ladyem McDivitt) and then invited them to join us to discuss their work, the data they use, how they manage that data, the challenges the data presents, and the methods they use to overcome those challenges. The workshop complimented the events of the Mellon Sawyer Seminar Series at the Center for Textual and Spatial Humanities, [*The Data that Divides Us*](https://cesta.stanford.edu/research/2023-2024-mellon-sawyer-seminar-series-data-divides-us?search=data+that+divides+us).
