I co-hosted this three-part round-table style workshop in Spring 2023 with PhD candidates in history and computer science. Our collaboration was funded by a Graduate Resources for Equity and Access in Teaching Grant from Stanford’s Center for Teaching and Learning. 

Just six months after OpenAI launched ChatGPT’s public chatbot in November 2022, our proposal was to pause and reflect on large language models as a set of technologies with the potential to either enhance or diminish equity and access in teaching. We designed the workshop for PhD candidates, knowing that our multiple instituional roles (as students, researchers, instructors, and teaching assistants) offer unique insights. 

A dozen graduate instructors attended our two sessions, bringing expertise from science, engineering, humanities, and social science disciplines to the discussion. Seven participants co-wrote a resource document summarizing our conversation and the teaching strategies we discussed.
