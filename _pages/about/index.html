I am a Graduate Dissertation Fellow at the <a href="https://gender.stanford.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Clayman Institute for Gender Research</a>. I was previously a dissertation fellow at the <a href="https://cesta.stanford.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis</a> as a part of the Mellon Sawyer Seminar “The Data that Divides Us.” I will complete my PhD in comparative literature in June 2025.</p> <p>My dissertation analyzes the construction of white negritude by Vallières, Aimé Césaire, and Dany Laferrière, three men who defined their literary careers in writing about blackness. I argue that white negritude emerged from the reception of Caribbean literature in Quebec from the 1960s onwards, and white Quebec’s identification with the Afro-diaspora thereafter.</p> </body></html>
