“Data for Humanists,” Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis, Stanford U, Winter-Spring 2024
I co-hosted this six-part workshop with the goal of setting a low barrier to entry for graduate and advanced undergraduate students wanting to explore the affordances of using data to build and sustain humanistic arguments. We assigned the work of digital humanities scholars local to Stanford (Quinn Dombrowski, among others) and then invited them to join us to discuss their work, the data they use, how they manage that data, the challenges the data presents, and the methods they use to overcome those challenges.

“Teaching in the Age of Generative AI: Grad Instructor Roundtable,” Center for Teaching and Learning, Stanford U, Spring 2023
I co-hosted this three-part workshop with PhD candidates in history and computer science. Our collaboration was funded by a Graduate Resources for Equity and Access in Teaching Grant from Stanford’s Center for Teaching and Learning. Just six months after OpenAI launched ChatGPT’s public chatbot, our proposal was to pause and reflect on large language models as a set of technologies with the potential to either enhance or diminish equity and access in teaching across science, engineering, humanities, and social science disciplines. A dozen graduate instructors attended our two sessions, from and seven participants co-wrote a resource document summarizing our conversation and the teaching strategies we discussed. 

“Zotero for Writing,” Hume Center for Writing and Speaking, Stanford U, 2024-2025
I designed and delivered this workshop three times for history majors preparing their honor’s thesis and capstone projects. After I demo Zotero for citation management and bibliography, the learners experiment with the “slip-box method” for note-taking, which gives priority thoughtful organization of ideas and notes, using “child notes” and tagging functions within Zotero.
