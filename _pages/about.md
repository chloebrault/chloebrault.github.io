Bonjour/hi! I am a Graduate Dissertation Fellow at Stanford’s Clayman Institute for Gender Research. I was previously a dissertation fellow at Stanford’s Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis as a part of the Mellon Sawyer Seminar “The Data that Divides Us.” I will complete my PhD in comparative literature at Stanford in June 2025. 

I study French and francophone literature, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and computational text analysis. My dissertation analyzes the construction of white negritude by Vallières, Aimé Césaire, and Dany Laferrière, three men who defined their literary careers in writing about blackness. My latest writing investigates the relationship between masculinity, charisma, and authority for francophone literary writers.
