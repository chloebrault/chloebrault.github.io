Bonjour/hi! 

I am a Graduate Dissertation Fellow at the [Clayman Institute for Gender Research](https://gender.stanford.edu/). I was previously a Mellon Sawyer Graduate Dissertation Fellow at the [Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis](https://cesta.stanford.edu/). I will be wrapping up PhD in comparative literature in June 2025. This website is for my work with computational methods.

I describe text corpora as data in [an interview](https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2024/05/where-data-and-the-humanities-intersect) for _Stanford Report_. And in [an essay](https://shc.stanford.edu/arcade/interventions/places-and-uses-data) published by _Arcade: The Humanities in the World_, I argued that, for humanists, data presents an opportunity to examine methods, scale claims, and iterate arguments. 

I attended DHSI in June 2024. At DH2024 in August, I participated in the pre-conference event co-organized by [ADHO Multilingual DH Special Interest Group](https://multilingualdh.org/) and [DARIAH Multilingual DH Working Group](https://multilingual.hypotheses.org/). I presented online at ACH in November 2024. 

I will be presenting my latest computational text analysis research at the Global Digital Humanities Symposium at Michigan State University in April 2025. Find me there, or at the 2025 MLA Convention in New Orleans in January! At MLA, I will be drawing on my research in generative artifical intelligence and my work in writing tutoring to talk about the differences between writing and revising, how large language models have us confusing writing with revising, and how to separate the two.
