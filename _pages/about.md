Bonjour/hi! 

I am a Graduate Dissertation Fellow at the [Clayman Institute for Gender Research](https://gender.stanford.edu/). I was previously a Mellon Sawyer Graduate Dissertation Fellow at the [Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis](https://cesta.stanford.edu/). I will be wrapping up PhD in comparative literature in June 2025. 

This repository is for my work with computational methods. 

I describe text corpora as data in [an interview](https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2024/05/where-data-and-the-humanities-intersect) for _Stanford Report_. And in [a recent piece](https://shc.stanford.edu/arcade/interventions/places-and-uses-data) published by _Arcade: The Humanities in the World_, I argued that, for humanists, data presents an opportunity to examine methods, to scale claims, and to iterate arguments. 

I participated in "the Multilingual Special Interest Group" at DH2024, and I will be presenting latest developments in my computational text analysis research at the "Global Digital Humanities Symposium" at Michigan State University in April 2025. 

Find me at the 2025 MLA Convention in New Orleans! I will be presenting about something a bit different coming from my work in writing tutoring: the differences between writing and revising, and how to separate the two.
