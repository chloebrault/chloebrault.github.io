Bonjour/hi! I am a Graduate Dissertation Fellow at the [Clayman Institute for Gender Research](https://gender.stanford.edu/). I was previously a Mellon Sawyer Graduate Dissertation Fellow at the [Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis](https://cesta.stanford.edu/). I will complete my PhD in comparative literature in June 2025. 

My dissertation analyzes the construction of white negritude by Vallières, Aimé Césaire, and Dany Laferrière, three men who defined their literary careers in writing about blackness. I argue that white negritude emerged from the reception of Caribbean literature in Quebec from the 1960s onwards, and white Quebec’s identification with the Afro-diaspora thereafter.
