Bonjour/hi! I am a Graduate Dissertation Fellow at Stanford’s [Clayman Institute for Gender Research](https://gender.stanford.edu/). I was previously a dissertation fellow at Stanford’s [Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis](https://cesta.stanford.edu/) as a part of the Mellon Sawyer Seminar “The Data that Divides Us.” I will complete my PhD in comparative literature at Stanford in June 2025. 

My dissertation analyzes the construction of white negritude by Vallières, Aimé Césaire, and Dany Laferrière, three men who defined their literary careers in writing about blackness. Whereas Negritude was a mode of critique born of Paris’ interwar Afro-diaspora, white negritude, I argue, emerged from the reception of Caribbean literature in Quebec from the 1960s onwards, and white Quebec’s identification with the Afro-diaspora thereafter.
