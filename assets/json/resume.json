        "I apply the principles of Students’ Right to Their Own Language by working collaboratively with my learners, meeting them where they are at, offering the perspective of a generalist reader, and ultimately trusting and affirming their judgments and expertise. The graduate students and post-docs who schedule recurring appointments with me are training in Performance Studies, Black Studies, Education, Sustainability, Law, Medicine, and Computer Science. In this role, I also regularly design and run workshops for undergraduates on topics such as “Zotero for Writing.”"

        "While completing my PhD, I taught eight courses for the Stanford Language Center. Between Fall 2018 and Fall 2019, I taught the French first-year sequence—which had me alone in the classroom with my students for 55 minutes, five days a week—and one course from the second-year sequence of my own design. My classroom practices are informed by my pedagogical training in proficiency-based learning and certification with the American Council of the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL), and the work I completed to earn a Certificate in Language Program Management, including an internship in language program management at Stanford’s Language Center."
