I argue that claims to the global shifted to become claims for the local exactly when Quebec’s independence movement lost political momentum.

In this project, we compiled, counted, and characterized claims to globality across texts published in leftist magazines published from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, including Parti Pris, Cité Libre, and Québec-presse. We prototyped the project on 40 magazine issues, iteratively experimenting with named entity recognition and topic modeling. We argue that claims to the global shifted to become claims for the local exactly when Quebec’s independence movement lost political momentum.
