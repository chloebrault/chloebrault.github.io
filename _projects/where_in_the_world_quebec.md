We compiled, counted, characterized, and visualized claims to globality across texts published in leftist magazines published from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, including _Parti Pris_, _Cité Libre_, and _Québec-presse_. We prototyped the project on 40 magazine issues, iteratively experimenting with named entity recognition and topic modeling.
