Between 1968 and 1971, Pierre Vallières got all the good press he and the Quebec separatist movement wanted with his book, White \[N-words\] of America. In the decades since, critics called Vallières’ first book a “classic” and an “integral part of Quebec history.” By 2019 however, those who continued to utter the title in Canadian universities and on public radio and television started to face denunciation. Complaints led to putative cancellations, followed by investigations, new legislation regarding hateful anti-Black language on publicly funded media, and finally, arguments against censorship in the name of free speech and the preservation of Quebecois culture. This project built a corpus of references to White \[N-words\] of America in French-language newspapers that spanned 1968 to 2023. How did the language around Vallières’ book change? How did it stay the same? We used computational tools including topic modeling and PCA to identify and characterize the key positions in conversation around this book, both historically and currently.
