We analyzed the reception of Pierre Vallières’ _White [N-Words] of America: The Precocious Autobiography of a Quebec Terrorist_ in French-language Canadian print media since 1968. _White [N-Words] of America_ has not had a new edition or reprint since 2011. However, between 2019 and 2023, the book was at the center of a series of heated debates about academic freedom and hate speech. I argue that by 2022, Vallières’ book had become untouchable, and uttering the full title became a litmus test for freedom of expression and willingness to stand up for and defend Quebec culture. In work first developed this research at Stanford’s Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis and Literary Lab, my undergraduate research intern, Clare Chua, and I used web scraping to compile corpora, Named Entity Recognition, topic modeling, Principal Component Analysis, word shift graphs, word embeddings, and Paired Pointwise Mutual Information scores to measure how the language around Vallières’ book changed between the late 1960s and 2020s, and how it stayed the same. We found that White [N-Words] of America was initially imagined as having international reach, and relevance to contemporary affairs happening as remotely as Argentina and Iran. Later, the discourse exclusively centered on Quebec. I argued that claims to the global relevance of White [N-Words] of America shifted to become claims for the local exactly when Quebec’s independence movement lost political momentum. I presented these findings most recently at the Association for Computers and the Humanities in November 2024.

This research was conducted as a part of my Digital Humanities fellowship at Stanford's Center for Textual and Spatial Analysis (CESTA).
