This dissertation analyzes the construction of White Negritude by Pierre Vallières, Aimé Césaire, and Dany Laferrière, three men who defined their literary careers in writing about blackness. Whereas Negritude was a mode of critique born of Paris’ interwar Afro-diaspora, White Negritude, I argue, emerged from the reception of Caribbean literature in Quebec from the 1960s onwards, and white Quebec’s identification with the Afro-diaspora thereafter. With Negritude, blackness could discursively exist independently from whiteness. Negritude broke with the logics of early modern race-making distilled in the Black Code of 1685, which classified Black people as moveable assets, and then, in 1723, was updated to explicitly codify whiteness against blackness. White Negritude restored these logics three centuries later as a discourse of whiteness emerging from, and in explicit reference to, discourses of blackness. Vallières was a white man from Quebec, Césaire, a Black man from Martinique, and Laferrière, a Black man from Haiti. Vallières started out by rallying white working-class men for Quebec separatism with language that evoked early modern racial slavery, Black Power, and third world radicalism. In his 1987 address “What is Negritude To Me?”, Césaire cited Vallières as the most prominent successor for Negritude in the second half of the twentieth century followed by Martin Luther King Jr. Broadly recognized as the “father” of Negritude, Césaire thus legitimized Vallières’ misappropriation all while overlooking the class politics that Vallières initially sought to advance. Laferrière then satirized not just Vallières, but the interest he had garnered both from key figures of the Black radical tradition like Césaire since the mid 1960s. “The Brief and Storied Life of White Negritude” gives new meaning to how whiteness and blackness are co-constitutive, and the truism that we cannot have one without the other.
